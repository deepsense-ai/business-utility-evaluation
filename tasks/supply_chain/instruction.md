# Supply Chain

Using only the generated supply chain outputs, determine which producers should be treated as `confirmed` quality offenders for each product.

Business context:
- The factory wants to improve service quality for stores in order to maximize long-term revenue.
- Low-quality deliveries can temporarily reduce future sales because disappointed consumers may stop buying a product for some time.

Important simulation mechanics you must consider:
- Time is discrete and measured in days.
- Producers deliver to a wholesaler, the wholesaler fulfills store orders, and stores sell to consumers.
- Each store keeps inventory as a FIFO queue of batches, so an old batch can affect later sales until it is depleted.
- Store-side intake must be reconstructed from `/app/raw_orders/`.
- Supplier-side intake must be reconstructed by joining `/app/raw_supplier_receipts/` with `/app/raw_wholesaler_receipts/`.
- `/app/raw_wholesaler_receipts/` only tells you which supplier was accepted in which daily sequence number; line items and quantities live in the supplier documents.
- Store allocation order must be reconstructed from `/app/raw_wholesaler_store_receipts/`; these receipts expose only store sequence plus total delivered units for the day, not per-product deliveries.
- Consumers have product-specific minimum quality thresholds.
- If a consumer receives a batch below the required quality, that consumer enters a staged 14-day recovery period for that product: days 1-3 at 20% demand, days 4-7 at 50%, days 8-14 at 80%, then back to 100%.
- Demand also contains an exogenous global calendar component with a summer vacation dip and a holiday/new-year effect. This calendar signal is shared across stores but differs in strength by product.
- The wholesaler uses brutal first-come fulfillment, so producer order and store order matter when tracing downstream effects.

Task:
- Infer, for every product `P_x`, the set `confirmed`.
- `confirmed` means producers that, based on the observed trajectory, can be treated as having definitely caused at least one consumer quality rejection for that product.

Dataset:
- `/app/raw_orders/`
- `/app/raw_supplier_receipts/`
- `/app/raw_wholesaler_receipts/`
- `/app/raw_wholesaler_store_receipts/`
- `/app/sales_log.csv`

Answer format:
- Write your final answer to `/app/answer.json`.
- Return a JSON object.
- Use product IDs as object keys.
- Use arrays of producer IDs as values.
- Sort producer IDs ascending inside each array.
- If a product has no confirmed producers, use an empty array.

Example:

```json
{"P_1": ["PR_7", "PR_12"], "P_2": []}
```
